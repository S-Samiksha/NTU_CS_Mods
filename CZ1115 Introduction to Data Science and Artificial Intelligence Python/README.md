# CZ1115_Introduction To Data Science and Artificial Intelligence 
These are the files for the module CX1115 Introduction to DSAI. 
These are for my own personal reference 
Notes and codes are taken from lecture notes, the documentations from https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html
In this module, we analyse House Sale Prices and variables that could affect sale price.
The data set was taken from:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques 

In this module I did the following:
Data Cleaning, Exploratory Analysis, visualising data, linear regression, decision tree

**DSAI Example Class Folder:** The very first lab exercise that we did. Additionally, I did a data cleaning and manipulation of medal tallies from 2004 Olympics to 2016 Olympics. 

**DSAI Example Class 2, 3 Folder:** These labs were to get familiar to the Pandas Module and the various functions we could do. 

**DSAI Example Class 4:** We had to predict the Sale Price of a house using Linear Regression. This Jupyer Notebook has my own analysis that I submitted for the assignment. 

**DSAI Example Class 5:** Using a decision tree, we had to predict whether the house had Central Air Conditioning or not. This Jupyer Notebook has my own analysis that I submitted for the assignment.
